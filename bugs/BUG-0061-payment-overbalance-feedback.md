# BUG-0061 — Over-balance payment submissions provide no feedback

Status: reproduced; open. Category: product. Priority: **P2** (medium). First/current observed candidate v2.5.11 ·0bcdf4d; earlier affected versions unknown. See [consolidated run](../runs/RUN-20261016-broad-workflows.md) and [exact manual checks](../runs/CHECKS-20261016-broad-workflows.json), groupBW-UI01.

## Evidence

Product: **v2.5.11 · 0bcdf4d**, SHA `0bcdf4d992c6e7254448ab27ee2e7bfc1535ec8c`. Environment: owner-authorized disposable staging https://bookone.clossyan.com.

No product or test implementation changed. Previous isolated automated results are historical, not rerun here. Rulebook 1.0.0 / `abcdd8970b1c36e62a97c6a111d6088ca97067ad3d6e954f64250b67989b39fc`, referenced rules revision1; expert review remains pending.

- Rules: RB-UI-01 revision1, RB-PAY-02 revision1.
- Preconditions: BW261016 run-owned records as listed in the consolidated fixture table. Normal supported UI; no database repair, request injection or financial replay.

### Reproduction

Pay vendor300 against due240; separately receive300 against due275.50. Click Record payment once and inspect settled UI and JS dialog.

**Expected:** Visible actionable over-balance validation; no posting; preserve inputs.

**Actual and persisted effects:** Both forms stay unchanged with active button/total300 and no inline/global/dialog message. Vendor input reports valid=true,max empty. Subsequent distinct valid100 and75.50 succeed.

**Observed boundary:** Final totals show only valid allocations; no claim excess300 posted.

First attempt preserved. Trigger executed once per named variant unless separate control explicitly described. Frequency across other accounts/builds/races is unknown. Screenshots were captured in browser session only; no durable screenshot checksum/trace archive. Sanitized DOM-visible outcomes and retained synthetic documents are canonical evidence. No private credentials, real customer data, raw logs or tokenized links published.

## Investigation

Confirmed: observations above. Component/internal exception/database root cause unverified; no new product graph tools were available in this session. This is deployed behavioural evidence, not a source review. Check adjacent source conversions, product types, history, settings and roles before classifying shared causes. No blanket workaround or data migration accepted. See handoff for bounded workarounds/control distinctions.

## Fix and regression

No fix commit or passing retest yet. Add a lasting independent assertion for the exact expected/actual example and adjacent valid/invalid transitions; critical gates need failure-sensitivity evidence. Retest on a fresh run-owned fixture with exact new product/QA/runtime fingerprint. Verify zero forbidden financial/stock/audit changes on rejection and preserved valid positives; inspect role/period/tenant boundaries. Retain original evidence and assess existing-record correction without silently rewriting issued history. Do not close from source change/CI alone.


## Appended v2.5.12 retest — 2026-10-16

Both customer300 against180 and vendor601 against600 immediately displayed Payment cannot exceed balance due. Earlier delayed snapshots missed3200ms notifications; absence claims withdrawn. Prior excess submissions created no allocated money/journal. Server bypass/races unrun.
